  ## Starting Off
  I started this application by building a simple datatbase in MySQL Workbench.  The database consited of a few simple tables that were populated with data.  
  The database in MySQL needed to be linked to the index.js file in order for the  application to work.





  ## Installation
  I used the MySQL NPM package to connect to the database to perform queries.
  The Inquirer NPM package is needed to interact with the user via the command-line.
  The following shows what to write at the command line in order to be able to run the application:


  * npm init
  * npm install
  * npm install mysql2






  ## Credits
  Mike Hoyt played a big part in getting this application to work.






  ## License
  Currently there are not any licenses for this application.  We hope to have a license in the near future.
